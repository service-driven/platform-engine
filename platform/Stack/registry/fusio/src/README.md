This folder contains custom action or connection implementations. These can be
used to solve project specific requirements. Please take a look at the `adapter`
chapter at the documentation if you want to write reusable components for Fusio.

If you want to see the Fusio backend code take a look at the `fusio/impl` 
composer package.
